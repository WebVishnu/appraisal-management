1. Always think of the most system-optimized solution before writing code.
   Understand the problem fully and choose the simplest, most efficient approach.

2. Write the minimum amount of clean, readable, and optimized code.
   Less code means fewer bugs, easier maintenance, and better scalability.

3. Never create new components, files, or modules immediately.
   First explore the existing codebase and extend or adjust current structures if possible.

4. Do not duplicate logic.
   Reuse, refactor, or generalize existing functionality instead of rewriting it.

5. Create something new ONLY when the existing structure cannot logically support the requirement.
   Every new addition must have a clear, single responsibility and long-term value.
